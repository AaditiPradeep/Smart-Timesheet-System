# Smart Timesheet Validation and Approval System
1. Project Overview
The Smart Timesheet Validation and Approval System is a web-based application designed to simplify and improve the process of employee timesheet submission, validation, and managerial approval.
The system focuses on reducing manual effort for managers by automatically validating timesheet data, identifying policy violations and unusual work patterns, and prioritizing entries that require closer review. By combining rule-based checks, historical analysis, and clear dashboards, the system enables efficient, transparent, and accurate timesheet management across organizations. 

2. Problem It Solves
In many organizations, managers are required to review a large number of employee timesheets regularly. This process is often time-consuming and error-prone, as managers must manually verify reported hours, detect inconsistencies, and ensure compliance with organizational policies. Existing timesheet systems primarily focus on basic data collection and submission, offering little support for intelligent validation or anomaly detection.
As a result, managers either spend excessive time on manual checks or approve timesheets without sufficient insight. This system addresses the problem by enabling exception-based review, where managers can focus primarily on high-risk or unusual entries while routine submissions are handled efficiently. 

3. Target Users
Employee
Submits weekly timesheets
Saves drafts and edits entries before submission
Views approval status, risk score, and feedback
Resubmits rejected timesheets after corrections

Manager
Reviews submitted timesheets
Prioritizes reviews using risk scores and validation flags
Approves or rejects timesheets with clear reasoning

System Administrator
Manages users and assigns roles
Configures validation rules and risk thresholds
Maintains system configuration and monitoring

4. Vision Statement
To build a reliable timesheetvalidation and approval system that reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and supports managers through automated validation and risk-based prioritization.

5. Key Features 
Simple and intuitive timesheet submission for employees
Secure authentication with role-based access control (Employee, Manager, Admin)
Automated rule-based validation of work hours and policy compliance
Risk scoring and identification of unusual or potentially inaccurate timesheets
Manager dashboards with prioritized review based on risk levels
Approval and rejection workflows with clear feedback
Notifications to keep employees and managers informed
Audit logs to ensure transparency and accountability

6. Success Metrics
The success of the system will be measured using the following criteria:
The system supports all core workflows: submission, validation, approval, rejection, and notification
At least 95% of core use cases execute successfully without defects
Validation rules and risk scores are correctly applied to all submitted timesheets
At least 90% of high-risk test cases are correctly flagged for managerial review
The project is completed within the defined timeline and meets all specified requirements. 

7. Assumptions 
• Employees, managers, and administrators have access to a web browser to use the system. 
• Users will enter timesheet data accurately and honestly within the defined reporting period. 
• Basic internet connectivity is available to access the web-based application. 
• Historical timesheet data (real or simulated) is available for analysis and testing purposes. 
• The development team has access to necessary tools and resources for development. 

8. Constraints 
• Must be developed within a 4-month timeline. 
• Use free or open-source technologies to minimize costs. 
• The system must ensure data privacy and basic security for user credentials, timesheet data, and audit records. 
• Historical timesheet data may be simulated for demonstration purposes. 
• The development is carried out by a student with intermediate programming skills.

8. Quick Start – Local Development (Docker)

This project uses Docker and Docker Compose to run the frontend, backend, and database in isolated containers for consistent local development.

🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

Git

Docker Desktop (AMD64 / x86_64)

Node.js (only required if running without Docker)

Web browser (Chrome/Firefox)

▶️ Running the Application Using Docker Compose

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd smart-timesheet-system


2️⃣ Build and start all services

docker-compose up --build


This command will:

Build the frontend and backend Docker images

Start the React frontend

Start the Node.js backend

Start MongoDB as a database container

🌐 Access the Application

Frontend (React UI):
👉 http://localhost:3000

Backend (API test):
👉 http://localhost:5000

🛑 Stopping the Application

To stop all running containers:

docker-compose down

🧰 Local Development Tools Used
